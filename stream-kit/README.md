# luciamuccia stream kit (MVP)

IRL / Just Chatting kit with a mauve Twitch vibe: overlays, panels, scripts, and a weekly plan.

## Quick start (OBS)

1) Create a new Scene for each overlay.
2) Add a Browser Source and point to the HTML file:
   - starting soon: overlays/starting-soon.html
   - brb: overlays/brb.html
   - ending: overlays/ending.html
   - live: overlays/live.html
3) Set size to 1920x1080.
4) Check "Shutdown source when not visible".

## Update text

Open the HTML files and edit the copy blocks. The main ones are:
- .title
- .subtitle
- .lower-third

## Contents

- brand/brand-kit.md
